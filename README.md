# Graphite
We thought that graphing applications such as Desmos were not as open sourced as they should be for such an essential application to many and we also thought that graphing calculators and the internet may not be available all the time, so it would be really convenient to have all these graphing utilities built into an application. Not to mention desmos and other graphing solutions have a plethora of issues such as not being able to graph things such as x^x properly!
It was only made using java and nothing else.
1400+ Lines of Code, High Schoolers from Monta Vista( 11th graders) in Silicon Valley.
You can enter any different type of equation and the application is able to graph it properly and you can zoom and pan in on the axes, we had to redefine PEMDAS(Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction) in order to account for edge cases that didn't graph properly with normal math functions such as -(x)^2 in comparison to (-x)^2 which gives two completely different answers, and need to get accounted for.

It can graph cosine, sine, tangent, and arc forms of all of those trigonometric functions.
Can graph circle functions as well!
We have added trigonometric functions and arcsine, arccosine, and arc tangent functions.
We also have a way to graph an infinite amount of equations at the same time.
You can zoom in and out of the graph using buttons! There is also an inbuilt calculator for convenience.
We also have a short-timed cutscene at the start with our project logo!
We took apart the equations using splitting methods and then we organized them into 2d arrays in order to be plotted on axes that used logarithms and rounding to get the proper value on the axes during zooms and pans. We have a zoom factor and the numbers scale with the amount of zoom!
Obviously, there is a lot more to it, so please do take a look at the code :)
